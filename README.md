## Summary

-	Based on the temperature data for the months of June and December, the shop can operate year-round based off highs and average temperatures.

-	Another query can be run on which stations had ideal temperatures in June and December to help decide on location.

-	Another query can be run on which stations had the least amount of precipitation during the months of June and December to help pick the best location to operate by avoiding low traffic or closures due to rain.
